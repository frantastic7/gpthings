# Sindarin translation

A terminal version of my Elanorion discord bot.

Simply provide the bot a sentence in English and you will get a Sindarin translation. (However, as I am not a Sindarin expert I do not guarantee the accuracy 100%, I am working on learning the language, and this script alongside the bot will be updated periodically to provide the best Sindarin learning experience available)

# Enviorment Variables
