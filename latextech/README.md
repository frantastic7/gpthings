# Latextech

Need notes? In a hurry? Don't have time to write down all the equations in LaTeX to make it look nice?  

Latextech has the solution, simply give it a prompt and it will generate notes, provide equations and compile a pdf file for you.  

Useage : "python3 latextech.py" 

The example pdf provided had simply the prompt "lagrangian"

The model is set to use 8k tokens. Feel free to modify.  

Still using gpt-3.5-turbo-16k for speed reasons. Feel free to switch to gpt-4 for more robust and complex notes.
