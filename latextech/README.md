# Latextech

Need notes? In a hurry? Don't have time to write down all the equations in LaTeX to make it look nice?  

Latextech has the solution, simply give it a prompt and it will generate notes, provide equations and compile a pdf file for you.  

Useage : "latextech.py size_argument" 

The example pdf provided had simply the prompt "lagrangian"

Size argument gives you the opportunity to customize the size of your output and control the token length. 
The prebuild lengths are in the toks dictionary (toks = {"s":512,"m":1024,"l":2048,"max":4096})

If you need more tokens feel free to change the model to the 16k token one.
