# Summary

Whisper + GPT3 powered tool used to transcribe and summarize youtube videos.
Using youtube-dl to download the videos.  

Youtube-dl has a bug as of writing this code. Big thanks to Jared Thomas (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ghe058HpmMk) for providing a hot fix.  

Use "-a" if you want the an AI generated voice to read the summary for you. 

For the AI voiceover I used the elevenlabs.io API (https://beta.elevenlabs.io). Feel free to modify the voice, all of the models are provided in the models.json file.
